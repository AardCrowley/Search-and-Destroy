# Search-and-Destroy
 Safe, Legal Search and Destroy

 # How to Install

 Multiple options, but two of the easier ways are:

 1. Click the green Code button in the top right and 'Download Zip'. Extract the XML file to wherever you store your plugins.
 2. Click on the Search and Destroy XML plugin file, then click on 'Raw' in the top right. Right-click the Raw page and 'Save As'. Save it to your plugin directory.

After having done this, Ctrl+Shift+P (or Command+Shift+P if on Mac, I believe) to open up Plugins, click 'Add', and then select the newly created XML file.

# Background

Years ago, WinkleWinkle ventured into what some may have considered dangerous territory and wrote the very first Search & Destroy plugin. Some people hated it, others loved it. Some people consider(ed) it botting, but it does not break any rules as-is. Some time after the initial creation, Fiendish made a change to the mapper database, and it broke WinkleWinkle's Search & Destroy plugin for many. Nokfah created a fix for it, however, and people were happy once more.

Then WinkleWinkle quit playing, and no more updates happened. Over time, people had forked his version in efforts of making their own, but one of the greatest forks happened when Starling got bored and decided to invest time into learning how it works as well as enhancing it even further. Pwar also created his own version, and Rauru created a similar version himself. There are probably several others out there, but none known more than Starling's or Pwar's versions.

Starling, unfortunately, was banned a while back. In an effort to make sure that Search & Destroy remained a legal script to use, it was asked that I take up the maintenance on it. So, here we are today, with further improvements to be made in the future.

# What is Search & Destroy?

Search & Destroy is a quality-of-life tool. It utilizes the mapper plugin in order to get to your quest mobs faster, your campaign targets faster, and yes, even global quest mobs. It makes every attempt to load up the keyword into an alias so all you have to do is type the alias and enter. It presents a window that displays your campaign or global targets (and eventually will show quest targets, perhaps tabbed). It uses its own runto feature in order to run to your personally chosen 'start' room of the area. To clarify, there are no 'start' rooms to any area. It's why the mapper plugin cannot just run you to an area because you tell it to.

In short, it can speed up your quests/campaigns/global quests. It is **NOT**, however, a bot as some may claim.

# What are the commands?

First and foremost, you should learn about **xhelp**. That will display, in the client, all the commands. Another one you should learn about is **snd update**, which will automatically update the plugin if changes are made and we post about it.
